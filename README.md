# Freevernote
Freevernote aims to be a free software replacement of Evernote, completely manageable from the command line. It is a single `bash` script with multiple functions.

It creates new markdown file, one for each new note. 

## Functionalities

- create new notes with `fvn new`
- search notes with `fvn search <regexp>` (based on `grep`) 
- count notes with `fvn count`

## TODO

- report of notes
- pdf and html export of notes
- report from searched notes
- weekly backup of notes (via `crontab`)
