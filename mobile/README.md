`index.html` contain a template to write notes on a web page. You can use it as
a special page in your site to write notes from your smartphones. A practical
`download` button let you save the file in the format `Ymd_HM`, where:

- `Y` is the year (e.g 2019) 
- `m` is the month (e.g. 07) 
- `d` is the day (e.g. 03) 
- `H` is the hour in which you opened the page (e.g. 11) 
- `M` is the minute in which you opened the page (e.g. 11) 

An example file would be `20190703_1111.md`.

On most mobile browser is straightforward to share the saved file to your
favourite cloud storage.
